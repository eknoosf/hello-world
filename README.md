# hello-world

It is so fascinating to know what human beings are capable of and how many things they have done till now.
Yet, we still struggle to maintain a continuous state of joy and happiness.
We have learnt to engineer the external but have we really tried to engineer our interiority the way we want it.
If we gain a little mastery over our own mechanism, life would be dramatically different than what we experience it to be.
Just like there is a whole science and technology of creating the outside the way we want it, there is science and technology to create ourselves the way we want it. We call it Inner Engineering. 
A world full of love, light and laughter. It's time has come. Let's make it happen!
